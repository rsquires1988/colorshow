Shows colors currently set in GNOME terminal's Edit > Preferences > Colors tab for the currently selected profile for testing out custom color choices and their combinations.

Invoke with ./colorshow.sh

Standard output shows escape characters for the palette colors.

Use flag '-p' for palette number output. (recommended, will become the default later)
